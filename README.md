# Recipes-generator

This is my first project that I've created from scratch :),


# Overview
Recipes Generator is a web application designed to simplify meal planning by helping users discover recipes based on the ingredients they already have. The goal of this project is to reduce the time and effort spent deciding what to cook by providing recipe suggestions that match available ingredients.

# Motivation
The inspiration for this project came from a common frustration: It took me too much time to think what to eat.

# Features
Ingredient Input: Users can enter a list of ingredients they have on hand.
Recipe Suggestions: Based on the provided ingredients, the application suggests recipes that can be prepared.
Recipe Details: Displays instructions and ingredients for each suggested recipe.

# Current Implementation
Currently, the recipe data is hardcoded into the application as an array of objects.  This is because I lack knowledge into handling APIs. Each recipe object includes:

Recipe name:
List of ingredients:
Instructions: not too much because i needed to write everything by hand.


# Future Improvements

feel free to contribute and if you have the skills and time you can add the following featurs to the project.


API Integration: if possible integrating an API to fetch recipes dynamically based on user input. This will allow for a more extensive and up-to-date recipe database.

User Interface Enhancements: Improving the UI to make it more easy to user  and visually appealing (better styling).

Advanced Recipe Matching: Implementing more sophisticated matching logic to suggest recipes based on partial ingredient matches and user preferences.


# Finally! 

I created this website in my local machine before even creating a repository and cloning it 
That's why there are not mant commits.
